# Strava
Contains data anlysis project completed in roughly 5 hours using data pulled from Strava. In it I looked at things like the relationship between photo-count (attached to a strava upload) and running speed, distance and kudos, and photos and kudos. There was a fair bit of data to play with, and I plan to come back to it at some point. 

The Strava notebook contains the code and its output.
